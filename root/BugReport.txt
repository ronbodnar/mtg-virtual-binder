FIXED BUGS
==========
1) Fixed a visual bug where prices weren't showing proper decimals for USD format
2) Removed foil cards using data from the price API (currently set to TBD until functionality is planned)
3) Land cards are not supported (search for Polluted Delta)
4) When moving cards to a different binder, the card info minus quantity is missing, line 71 of functions.php
5) I removed "Aegis Angel" From rare and it added a blank text like it alerady had at the very top, so now there's 4. 

=========
CHANGELOG
=========
1) Added card rarity to all binders, visible only to the owner of the binders
2) Add / remove tabs is now functioning
3) Added a card count to each binder tab
4) Added table sorting support for the search table and all binder tables

============
CURRENT TODO
============
1) Move cards between binders from the binders themselves

===========
SUGGESTIONS
===========
1) Remain on the current binder tab when updating
2) Total price of all cards in all binders
3) Manual price updates
4) The ability to color-code binders [will be done in admin UI]

==============
FUTURE CONTENT
==============
1) Simplistic Admin UI for easier customization
2) The ability for users to rename their binders
3) Contact form for buyers looking to contact binder owners
